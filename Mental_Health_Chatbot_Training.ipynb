But the added responsibilities and pressure have just taken a toll on my mental health. It's been a really moving experience for me.

It's an important part of the healing process.

A healthy work-life balance is essential. Have you tried any strategies to cope with the added workload? </s><s>[INST] I've been trying to prioritize my tasks and delegate whenever possible. I've also started practicing meditation during my breaks to help manage stress. But sometimes, it feels like no matter what I do, I can't catch a break. It's been a constant struggle. [/INST] It's great to hear that you're already implementing some helpful strategies. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. In addition to what you're already doing, I encourage you to also communicate with your supervisor or team about your workload and discuss possible solutions together. </s><s>[INST] You're right. I haven't really opened up about my struggles to my coworkers or supervisor. I guess I've been afraid of appearing weak or incapable. How can I approach this discussion without feeling vulnerable? [/INST] It's completely normal to feel that way, but remember, asking for support is a strength, not a weakness. Start by scheduling a conversation with your supervisor or a trusted colleague in a private and comfortable setting. Be honest about your challenges and express your willingness to find solutions together. Remember, you're not alone in this. </s><s>[INST] Thank you for your understanding and guidance. I appreciate the reminder that I don't have to face this alone. I'll gather my courage and initiate that conversation soon. I need to prioritize my well-being and find a healthier balance.

Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. You've got this! </s>\"}"

Because I don't feel the same type of anxiety I use to . I get more scared and paranoia asf. Like I get scared ppl gonna hurt me and shit. And paranoia of people looking at me and the shit around me. Well Actually I can't say that, I think I still do have a bit anxiety left in me. nI'm so fucking lazy bc of depression like I can't feel myself at all, I mean I was never able to but this time I'm so fucking lowwwwwwww as hell like to the point idgaf if I get hit by a car when crossing a street. nI feel so angry and sad and just wanna scream on the top of my lungs. And also I've been having this thing where I get a lot of energy, I don't know how or why. But I go into like manic mode like have a shit ton of energy and I can't stop or slow down I'm going full speed and I get bored so easily and I can't sit still. And I forget shit all the time like seconds after I do something. And I don't even take care of myself really anymore, I mean I try to but I keep forgetting and just get distracted or I say ima do it then I end up doing something else and I tell myself ima get back to it but I never do.  And eating for me has become a less priority like, I don't know why but not just recently like for a while now I just don't care to eat because tbh everything taste like the fucking same. There is never a good cheeseburger or whatever that I like, it's all the fucking same and taste the same like everything I eat. nAnd it's all so boring and I just haven't been hungry at all cause my mental health is ass but I force myself to eat anyways even tho I don't enjoy or like pretty much everything I eat, it's just about surviving. And I dropped down to 98 pounds. [/INST] Are you taking any meds/supplements? If I take Prozac without any food, I will get nauseous and throw it up.
